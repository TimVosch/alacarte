# Ã€ la carte ðŸ¥ž; a composable DB mapper with relations

**alacarte** (Ã€ la carte) is a flexible Go data mapper that allows you to selectively fetch and resolve only the fields 
and relations you need.

It is designed to allow users to choose what fields and relations they need, it helps you avoid over-fetching and N+1 
query problems, without providing a fully blown ORM.

The philosophy is simple: you order exactly what you want, Ã  la carte.

## Features

  * **Type-Safe Generic Models**: Uses Go generics (`alacarte.NewModel[T]`) for type-safe model definitions, without 
    *any* type assertion.
  * **Selective Field Loading**: Choose exactly which model fields to load for any given query.
  * **Powerful Relational Mapping**: Define and eager-load `HasMany` or `HasOne` relationships with batched queries to prevent the N+1 problem.
  * **Nested Selection & Resolution**: Use intuitive dot-notation (e.g., `"user.posts.comments.id"`) to select and resolve fields and relations deep within your data model.
  * **Easy to use, Easy to extend**: Built to be flexible. Simple mapping functions are just helpers on top of advanced mapping functions.

Uses [Squirrel](https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel) behind the scenes for query generation.

## Installation

```sh
go get pollex.nl/alacarte
```

## Example

Basic example of schema creation and querying.

```go
// Your domain model
type Author struct {
    ID   uint64
    Name string
    Tags []string
}

// The alacarte mapper
var AuthorSchema = alacarte.New[Author]("authors"). 
    AddSimpleField("id", func(a *Author) any { return &a.ID }).
    AddSimpleField("name", func(a *Author) any { return &a.Name }).
    // A field with transformation. Could - for example - also query `ST_X(loc), ST_Y(loc)` and map to []float64
    AddField("tags", alacarte.Col("tags"),
        func(t *Author) (alacarte.Ptrs, alacarte.Action) {
            var tagString string
            return alacarte.Ptrs{&tagString}, func() {
                t.Tags = strings.Split(tagString, ",")
            }
        },
    )

// List queries all Authors in the database and returns only the requested `fields` for the authors.
func (store *AuthorStore) List(ctx context.Context, fields []string) ([]Author, error) {
    authors, _ := AuthorSchema.Query(fields...).Collect(ctx, store.db)
    return authors
}

```

Basic example of a relation.

```go
var AuthorSchema = alacarte.New[Author]("authors"). 
    // ... Fields from example above
    AddRelation("books",
		alacarte.HasMany(
			BookSchema,
			func(author Author, book Book) bool { return book.AuthorID == author.ID },
			func(author *Author, books []Book) { author.Books = books },
            alacarte.WhereIDs("author_id", func(a Author) uint64 { return a.ID }),
		),
	)

func (store *AuthorStore) List(ctx context.Context) ([]Author, error) {
    // Will now resolve the books relation and return all book fields
    authors, _ := AuthorSchema.Query("id", "name", "books").Collect(ctx, store.db)
    // This will only return specific book fields
    authors, _ := AuthorSchema.Query("id", "name", "books.id", "books.name").Collect(ctx, store.db)
    // If books has relations as well (e.g. a genre), we can resolve them too.
    authors, _ := AuthorSchema.Query("id", "name", "books.id", "books.genre.name").Collect(ctx, store.db)
}
```

## Advanced Usage

Alacarte uses closures a lot. In simple cases this is abstracted away by helper functions such as `AddSimpleField` or 
`alacarte.Ptr` - if no post-scan action is required. 

### Fields

At the core of a ModelSchema there is a `map[string]FieldType` and a `map[string]Relation`. When querying for fields, 
FieldTypes and Relations are collected and executed. There is a bit of logic executed upon selecting a field which
resolves nesting and validation.

A `Field` or `FieldType` consists of three-ish elements:

- A name that uniquely identifies this mapping for this model;
    - This is only used in the ModelSchema. So not really a part of FieldType.
- A QueryModifier, that modifies the query in such a way that data becomes available for scanning to the pointer 
        in the RowScanner;
    - This is usually just a `q.Columns(....)` which adds columns to the SELECT query, but it can be more complex
        such as joining tables and doing something there.
- A RowScanner, that returns one or more pointers for each column in the QueryModifier and an `Action` that runs after scanning;
    - This is a closure, so it's possible to scan to temporary variables and use the Action to transform it into
        something that can be mapped to your model. See the "tags" example above.

### Relations

Creating a `Relation` requires three parameters:

- `child *ModelSchema[N]`: the related schema
- `binder Binder[M, N]`: a function that assigns []N childs to []M parents
    - Simple cases its looping over M and N and see if N.parent_id == M.id
- `where func(parents []M) QueryMod`: a query modifier that adds a filter on the child query to only return rows
    related to the parents.

and will have return closures:

- `Check(field string) error`: this validates if the given field exists on this schema. (Can be nested to relations.)
- `Resolve(ctx context.Context, db *sql.DB, parents []M, fields []string)`

The `Resolve` closure can now be used to load the relation to []M parent models.

The binder and wherer have helpers available. Usually you'll want to filter on child.parent_id = parent.ID. The 
`alacarte.WhereIDs` creates this query modifier for you. You specify the child's column that referes to a parent field,
and a function that returns said parent field from the model.

For example, the following adds a `WHERE <child_table>.book_id IN (?,?,?,...)`

```go
alacarte.WhereIDs("book_id", func(book Book) uint64 { return book.ID }),
```

Lastly the `binder` determines children and parents are matched, use HasMany or HasOne. These functions are actually 
helpers for calling CreateRelation with predefined binders. The only parameter that differs is `assign`, since HasMany 
assigns a slice and HasOne assigns a struct.

> [!NOTE] The current binders are dumb and just iterate over the parent and child slices, for better performance 
> consider creating a PR with binders that use maps :)

```go
// Signature
func HasMany[M, N any](
	child *ModelSchema[N],
	belongTogether func(M, N) bool,
	assign func(*M, []N),
	where func(parents []M) QueryMod,
) Relation[M] {

// Example:
alacarte.HasMany(comment,
    func(book Book, comment Comment) bool { return comment.BookID == book.ID },
    func(book *Book, comments []Comment) { book.Comments = comments },
    alacarte.WhereIDs("book_id", func(book Book) uint64 { return book.ID }),
),
```

# TODOs

- [ ] Automatically add required fields for Relation binding
    currently, the fields `id` and `books.author_id` must be in Select(...) for the .Resolve(...) to work.
- [ ] Probably many bugs, so more tests would be great
- [ ] Spent time on optimizations
- [ ] Improve API for simple fields and relations
